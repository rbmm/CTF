# CTF

Capture the Flag exercise.

written with the maximum degree of perversion and sadism. A separate question - what and how does the program do? Will someone be able to describe in detail.
the program, of course, does not change anything in the system and in the worst case will not start or will crash itself, but antiviruses clearly do not like it (14/69 security vendors flagged this file as malicious) and will interfere with its execution (so you need to run it in a system without them)

I think there is a lot of interesting stuff there, otherwise I wouldn't post it
